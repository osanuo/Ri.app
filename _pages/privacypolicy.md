## Information We Collect

### Data Stored Locally on Your Device

Ri stores the following information locally on your iOS device:

- **Completion Data**: Records of when you mark habits as complete or incomplete
- **Streak Information**: Calculated streak counts and historical tracking data
- **User Preferences**: App settings, notification preferences, and customization choices

- Send you notifications/reminders (only if you enable them)
- Provide statistics and insights about your habits

- **Consent**: You voluntarily choose to create habits and enter data
- **Contractual Necessity**: To provide the App's core functionality you requested
- **Legitimate Interests**: To enable core features like streak tracking and statistics

## Data Storage and Security

### Local Storage

All your data is stored locally on your device using:

- **No Cloud Servers**: We do not maintain any servers that store your personal data

### iCloud Sync (Optional)

If you choose to enable iCloud sync:

- Your habit data is synced across your Apple devices using your personal iCloud account
- This data is encrypted and stored in your private iCloud storage
- We cannot access your iCloud data
- This is entirely managed by Apple and subject to Apple's Privacy Policy
- You can disable iCloud sync at any time in the App settings

## Third-Party Services

Ri does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

If you purchase a subscription through the App Store:

If you are under the required age for your region, please do not use this App. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected information from a child under the required age, we will delete that information immediately.

### Disable Notifications
You can turn off notifications at any time in:
- The App's Settings
- Your device's Settings → Notifications → Ri

### Data Protection Authority

If you are in the EEA, you have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority. For Poland, this is:

**Urząd Ochrony Danych Osobowych (UODO)**  
Website: https://uodo.gov.pl

### Data Protection Officer

For GDPR-related inquiries or to exercise your rights, contact us at:

**Email**: osanuo@example.com  
**Response Time**: Within 30 days

## Data Retention

- **Active Use**: We retain your data locally on your device for as long as you use the App
- **App Deletion**: All local data is permanently deleted when you delete the App from your device
- **iCloud Data**: If you use iCloud sync, data remains in your iCloud until you delete it manually or disable iCloud sync
- **No Server Retention**: We do not store any of your data on our servers

## Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect your data:

- All data stored locally is protected by iOS security features
- Your device passcode/biometrics (Face ID/Touch ID) protect access to the App
- We do not transmit your personal data over the internet (except for optional iCloud sync, which uses Apple's encrypted channels)
- We do not store your data on our servers

However, no method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. You are responsible for:
- Keeping your device secure
- Using a strong device passcode
- Protecting your Apple ID credentials

## International Data Transfers

Ri is available worldwide. Your data is stored locally on your device, regardless of your location.

If you use iCloud sync:
- Your data may be transferred to and stored on Apple's iCloud servers
- Apple's servers may be located in various countries according to Apple's infrastructure
- Data transfers are protected by Apple's security measures and are subject to Apple's Privacy Policy
- For EEA users, Apple complies with GDPR requirements for international data transfers

## California Privacy Rights (CCPA)

If you are a California resident, you have rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). However, since Ri does not collect, sell, or share personal information with third parties, most CCPA provisions do not apply to our data practices.

You still have the right to:
- Access your data (available in the App)
- Delete your data (available in the App)
- Opt-out of data sale (we never sell data)

## Data Breach Notification

In the unlikely event of a data breach affecting your personal information:

- **EU Users**: We will notify you and relevant authorities within 72 hours as required by GDPR
- **All Users**: We will notify you via the App or email (if we have your contact information)

However, since we do not store your data on our servers, the risk of a data breach affecting your information is minimal.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by:

- Posting the new Privacy Policy on this page
- Updating the "Last Updated" date at the top
- Notifying you within the App for significant changes
- For material changes, requesting your consent where required by law

Your continued use of the App after changes are made constitutes acceptance of those changes, unless additional consent is required by applicable law.

## Automated Decision-Making and Profiling

Ri does not use automated decision-making or profiling that would have legal or similarly significant effects on you.

The App's statistics and insights features are:
- Calculated locally on your device
- Based solely on data you provided
- For your personal information only
- Not used for any automated decisions about you
