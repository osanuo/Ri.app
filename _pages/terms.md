## Subscriptions and Payments

### In-App Purchases

Ri may offer optional premium features through in-app purchases or subscriptions:

- **Free Features**: Core habit tracking functionality is available for free
- **Premium Features**: Advanced features may require a subscription
- **Pricing**: Current prices are displayed in the App and in the Apple App Store
- **Currency**: Prices are shown in your local currency

### Billing and Payment Processing

- All purchases are processed through Apple's App Store

- We do not collect, process, or store your payment information
- Payment disputes should be directed to Apple Support

### Subscriptions

If you purchase a subscription:

- **Auto-Renewal**: Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period unless cancelled
- **Cancellation**: You can cancel anytime through your App Store account settings (Settings → [Your Name] → Subscriptions)
- **Cancellation Effect**: Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period
- **No Partial Refunds**: Cancelling does not provide a refund for the current billing period
- **Price Changes**: We reserve the right to change subscription pricing with at least 30 days' notice

### Free Trials

When you purchase a subscription through the App Store, you typically consent to immediate access, which means you waive your right of withdrawal.
